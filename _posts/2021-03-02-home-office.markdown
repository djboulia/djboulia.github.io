I have reached the stage of the pandemic where I feel like I'm going to be permanently working from home and on Zoom/WebEx for the rest of my life.  I took stock of my home office setup and realized that I had largely been  getting by with a laptop and a pair of Airpods.  After moving my home office (for the third time) to its (hopefully) final location, I looked at other people's setups to make some improvements.

After going through a few different resources, I found that [Guido Appenzeller's][guido-link] blog post was super helpful.  He patterned his setup after Twitch streamers given they spend the majority of their time streaming audio and video.

Here is my setup:

# MacBook, Laptop Stand and Docking Station
Strictly speaking, the laptop stand is not necessary, but I found that putting the laptop on its edge freed up a lot of desk real estate for me.  For only $17 it I think it's been worth it.

I would highly recommend getting a docking station given that this set up generates a lot of connections between the laptop and the various peripherals (speakers, microphone, webcam, monitor all use some sort of USB and/or other connection).  

These stations can be upwards of $250, but I ended up with the Tobenone for $120 that I'm very happy with.  It comes with a cable that connects to the two USB-C ports on the side of a MacBook Pro. You can then plug your existing laptop charger into the back of the unit to charge your laptop plus all of the peripherals. If you go with this model, make sure you have a Mac with the double USB-C side port configuration.

# Speakers and Microphone
The Creative speakers were $19.99 for the pair.  They are USB powered and plug into the headphone jack on the hub.  Not too big so they take up only a small amount of desk real estate.  I positioned them at the back of the desk behind the microphone.  Good sound quality for as cheap as they are.

The microphone is where I splurged budget wise.  Yeti seems to be the brand of choice for podcasters and gamers alike.  At $110 I thought it was a little pricey, but the results have been fantastic.  The mic has a bunch of different modes, but I put mine in "Cardioid" mode so it wouldn't pick up anything behind it (such as the speakers), just sound coming from the front.  Perfect when hung over the display just out of view of the webcam.  I did go cheap on the microphone stand for $25 vs. the $70+ that the OEM Yeti would have been.

# Monitor and Webcam
The monitor was issued by my employer, so not much choice there.  Still, it is 4K and has done a great job.  In an earlier configuration I was using it as a "hub" of sorts, since it has USB-C connections that will power devices (like the laptop).  I found the charging to be very slow using this approach.  The docking station works much better.  If I had to buy a monitor, I would have gone for the big curved display like those listed in Guido's article.

The webcam was purchased mid-pandemic and is actually my second webcam. I went cheap the first time with a Chinese knock off USB webcam, but had lots of issues with it when used 12+ hours a day.  The Logitech was more expensive ($80) but has worked very well.  It delivers a crisp picture which I've gotten multiple compliments on from people on the other side of video meetings.  You can also download software from the Logitech site to get finer grained control of the picture.

# USB Charging Station
Believe it or not, even with the docking station, there are more USB connections with this setup than the dock can handle.  The two lights each take a USB connection, as does the headset, iPad charging cable, etc.  The Anker 6 port model was $26 and has plenty of juice to charge devices as well as power the lights.  It also gave me USB ports on the right hand side of the desk which cuts down on all of the cables running back and forth.

# Lights
This was another optional purchase that can be very expensive.  There are lights with all sorts of programmable features for dimming, turning on/off, etc.  I found a pair of LED lights for $32 that work just fine.  Each light has an on/off switch and dimmer controls.  If it stays plugged in, the light remembers the last dimmed setting.  I do have to turn each one on and off twice a day, but that works fine for me.

One thing I didn't like about the lights were the stands that came with them.  They're sort of flimsy and spreading them out to stabilize the light takes a lot of desk real estate.

Fortunately, the base does unscrew from the light post and the connector is a standard bolt size. So I went to Lowe's, got a couple of nuts and bolts ($2) and drilled a hole in each corner of the desk.  I threaded the bolt through the hole, used two nuts to secure it, and then screwed the light post onto the bolt. The result takes up minimal desk space and is much more stable than the stand.

# Headset
The headset was also issued by my employer, so choice was limited.  That said, many people are using it successfully based on the video conference calls I'm on all day.  I have a few issues with it.  First, wearing a headset all day for me personally is not comfortable; my ears start to hurt, or sweat, or both.  Second, I have always had issues with the microphone on headsets picking up my voice properly, and this happened on occasion with the boom on this headset.  Finally, if you're on video all day you look like you're working in a call center.  So I stopped using it.  To be honest, I'm not even sure why it's still on the desk.  When I'm in an environment where I can't use speakers and the Yeti, I just use the Airpods. I found putting one in at a time while charging the other allowed me to use them all day with no problems.

# Desk
The desk is definitely nothing special.  I went cheap and basic, but I did pay attention to the dimensions.  I started the pandemic on a desk we had purchased for one of the kids and found it to be too small to fit the monitor and laptop.  This model is 55" wide and 26" deep, so plenty of room to have keyboard, mouse and still be able to take notes or whatever on each side.

The desk was $99 but arrived with a chip out of the table top from shipping damage.  When we called Amazon, they refunded the money and told us to just keep the table.  A little wood filler and some black nail polish fixed it right up.  So, free desk.

In addition to the two mounting bolts for the lights, I also mounted a power strip underneath the table so I didn't have wires going all over the place.  I did this by cutting a piece of 1x3" wood to the right length, mounted the power strip to the board, then screwed the board into the frame of the desk.
